### What is Content Aggregation?
“Content aggregation” means the act of collecting content (blogs,
newsletters, news articles, social media posts, etc.) from various feeds to the
same place online. Aggregation can be done manually by people or
automatically by software tools.

### Goal
To create a content aggregator using python that can collect article
headlines and summary from source websites and present them in visually
appealing manner through a front end client web app.
### Technology stack
1. Web Scraping using Python (Requests/Urllib2 and BeautifulSoup)
2. Database (SQLite)
3. Python-Flask for hosting web app.
4. JINJA2 templates and HTML/CSS2
### Road Map
* Creating the Web Scraper (2-3 days)
* The trainees will learn about web scraping and create a simple web scraper that
can extract the headlines and a short summary of posts from various websites.
* Storing Data in DB ( 1 day)
* After successfully extracting the data from the websites the data will be stored in
a simple SQLite DB, the trainees will learn to work with databases and learn the
CRUD functionalities.
* Creating Web App (2-3 days)
* Finally to display the scraped data the trainees will create a simple FLASK
application and learn about the JINJA templating engine to cater the content
dynamically
### Conclusion
The trainees on completion will have basic knowledge about web scraping,
flask web framework and database concepts. These concepts can later on be
used by the trainees for their own personal projects.
