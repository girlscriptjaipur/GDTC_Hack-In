##1)Higher Lower Guessing Game
Create a game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and  50 and the user has to guess what the number is.

a)Add an introductory message that explains to the user how to play your game.
b)In addition to the congratulatory message at the end of the game, also print out how many guesses were taken before the user arrived at the correct answer.
c)At the end of the game, allow the user to decide if they want to play again (without having to restart the program).
