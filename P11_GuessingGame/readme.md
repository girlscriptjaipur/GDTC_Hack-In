## Higher Lower Guessing Game
- Create a game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50
and the user has to guess what the number is.

than the answer.
-When the user guesses the correct number, print out a congratulatory message.

Subgoals:
- Add an introductory message that explains to the user how to play your game.
- In addition to the congratulatory message at the end of the game, also print
out how many guesses were taken before the user arrived at the correct
answer.
- At the end of the game, allow the user to decide if they want to play again
(without having to restart the program).
