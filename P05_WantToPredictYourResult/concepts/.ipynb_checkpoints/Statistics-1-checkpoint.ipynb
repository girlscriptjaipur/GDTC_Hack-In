Also, for very small samples, the mode may have a frequency only one or two higher than the other scores—not very informative. Finally, no additional statistics are based on the mode. For these reasons, it is not as useful as the median or the mean."

Here is the rule: __With an odd number of scores, the median will be an actual score. But with an even number of scores, the median will not be an actual score. Instead, it will be the score midway between the two centermost scores. To get the midpoint, simply average the two centermost scores. In our example, this is (12 + 14)/2, which is 26/2, which is 13.__"

Other times an outlier represents a clerical error—the person was measured incorrectly or the score was entered into the data set incorrectly. Because outliers markedly affect the mean, researchers need to be especially alert for them so that they can determine whether the score legitimately belongs in the data set. Simply knowing the value of the mean does not, in itself, tell us that there is an outlier. Only visual inspection of the data tells us that. This is another reason why competent researchers always look at the data before calculating any statistic._"
