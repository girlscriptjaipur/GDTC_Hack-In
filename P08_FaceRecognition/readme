# AIM: To detect and recognize faces using OpenCV in python and track them. 
## MENTOR: Maitree Rawat 
## DIFFICULTY: Intermediate 
## SPECIFICATIONS:  
This project is for novice image processing programmers and learners. Image processing has become one of the most sought after fields of all time. This project focuses on to detect human faces by using Haar Cascades and track them further using KCF tracker. OpenCV object tracking implementation is huge and therefore some of the most important concepts will be covered here. Novice python programmers can also go for this project. The prerequisites for this project is basic understanding of mathematics, basic python programming knowledge & motivation to learn.  
## TECHNOLOGY STACK 
1) Python ( > 3 is preferred ) 
2) OpenCV 
3) IMUTILS VIDEO 
## ROADMAP 
1) Introduction to basic and intermediate OpenCV 
2) Acquaintance with OpenCV trackers such as KCF, CSRT etc. 
3) Real time detection and tracking experience. 
## FUTURE SCOPE 
1) Can be used with Raspberry pi with web cam to detect robbery. 
2) Can be used with Quadrone to track real time person. 3) Can be used to detect over speeding vehicles in smart traffic management system.
